#
# This file is the build script
# This works simalair to a bash script though it's better to see every line as a Dockerfile RUN execution
# 
# There are a view special things to consider here
#  - Same as with docker this script expects to run a script at the end
#    In docker this function is called `CMD` here it's called `FINAL`
#  - In comparison to docker there RUN command `cd` will work just fine here
#

# build the files
cd ..
echo "a long string"
ls
cd ./mini-exec

# run ls at the end because if we would run mini-exec it would loop forever
FINAL ls
